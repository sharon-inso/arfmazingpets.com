		<p>A <b>dolphin</b> is an <i>aquatic mammal</i> within the <abbr title="Order is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy. It is classified between family and class. ">infraorder</abbr> <abbr title="Cetacea is an infraorder of aquatic mammals that includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises.">Cetacea</abbr>. Dolphin species belong to the families <i class="taxonomy">Delphinidae</i> (the oceanic dolphins), <i class="taxonomy">Platanistidae</i> (the Indian river dolphins), <i class="taxonomy">Iniidae</i> (the New World river dolphins), <i class="taxonomy">Pontoporiidae</i> (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct <i class="taxonomy">Lipotidae</i> (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.

		<p><b>Dolphins</b> range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr> 7 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (31 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr> 2 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins exhibit <i>sexual dimorphism</i> where the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres (18 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) per hour or leap about 30 feet (9.1 <abbr title="meters">m)</abbr>.<b>Dolphins</b> use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

		<p><b>Dolphins</b> are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the <i class="place">tropic zones</i>, but some, such as the right whale dolphin, prefer <i class="place">colder climates</i>. <b>Dolphins</b> feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, such as the orca, feed on large mammals such as seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. <i class="taxonomy">Calves</i> are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. <b>Dolphins</b> produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

		<p><b>Dolphins</b> are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. <b>Dolphins</b> have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. <b>Dolphins</b> are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose <b>dolphin</b>, while there are around 60 orcas in captivity.
